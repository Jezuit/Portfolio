1. Built-in data types in Python language

• Mutable (Changeable after creation.) - example: list, dict, set
• Immutable (Unchangeable after creation) - example: str, tuple, int, float, bool

A. Numeric Types
  • int (Integer) - Represents whole numbers - example: number = 30
  • float (Floating-Point) - Represents real numbers that contain a decimal point (fractional part). - example: number = 19.99
  • complex - Represents complex numbers in the form a+bj, where 'a' is the real part and 'b' is the imaginary part. - example: number = 2 + 3j

B. Sequence Types
  • str (String) - An immutable sequence of characters (text), enclosed in single or double quotes. - example: word = "word"
  • list -
